    <p class="Story">I am Tenzin. I was born in Tibet, and after moving from one place to another, I arrived at a small village in India where I lived for some years. Then, I came to Switzerland. I am very interested in technology, and it has always fascinated me. Now that I am here and have the chance and resources to be able to learn coding, I'll do my best to learn it.</p>
